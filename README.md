# Lab-1-VR
My design intent for this project was to use preexisting assets from the farm vrtk to make an incredibly simple dress up game.
The player grabs and drops the head of the scarecrow to reattach it to the base, then attaches the hat to the head. 
I had a difficult time coding the boolean for the win condition.
